# ~/.bashrc additions
These are function and code i've added to my bashrc to makes life easier.

| File | Job |
| --- | --- |
| alt_bjob.config | Functions which make a nice BJOB output, specific to sanger compute but no reason why it couldn't be adapted. |
| command_prompt.config | A nice simple PS1 prompt. |
